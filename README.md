Business Performance Dashboard (Excel):
This project presents a fully interactive business performance dashboard built entirely in Microsoft Excel. It was created as part of my Business Analytics work to visualize key metrics in a clear and dynamic format.

Overview:
The dashboard provides a snapshot of key business data including revenue, profit, and category breakdowns. It uses Excel’s built-in tools to make the data easy to explore and understand, with filters that allow users to focus on specific areas of interest.

Tools and Techniques Used:

- Pivot tables and pivot charts for summarizing and visualizing data
- Slicers for interactive filtering
- Conditional formatting to highlight key values and trends
- Basic Excel formulas such as SUM and AVERAGE
- Clean layout and structure using Excel’s formatting tools

File Included:
Dashboard (master) 2.xlsx – the full Excel file with formulas, visuals, and working interactivity

Why This Project Matters:
Excel remains one of the most widely used tools in business environments. This project shows how it can be used to turn raw data into actionable insights without writing any code. It’s a practical example of how core Excel skills can be applied in real-world reporting and analysis.
